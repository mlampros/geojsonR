Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral is the opposite of panchromatic, \n# which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each pixel. Usually, Earth observation satellites have three or more radiometers (Landsat has seven). \n# Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The shortest is the visible band, ranging from 0.7 µm to 0.4 µm, called red-green-blue\n# (RGB) region. The others are infrared with wavelengths from 0.7 µm to 10 or more µm, classified as near infrared (NIR), middle infrared (MIR) and far infrared (FIR or thermal).[2] \n# In the Landsat case, the seven scenes comprise a seven-band multispectral image. Spectral imaging with more numerous bands, finer spectral resolution or wider spectral coverage may \n# be called hyperspectral or ultraspectral.\n\n\n# install rgdal on linux mint\n#----------------------------\n\n# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa\n\n# sudo apt-get update\n\n# sudo apt-get install gdal-bin\n\n# sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev\n\n# install.packages(\"rgdal\")              # In R-session\n\n\n\n",
