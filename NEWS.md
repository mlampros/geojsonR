## geojsonR 1.0.3

I added the *merge_files* function.


## geojsonR 1.0.2

I added the *FROM_GeoJson_Schema* function. This function is appropriate when the property-names do not match exactly the *RFC 7946* specification ( for instance if the *geometry-object-name* appears as *location*, as is the case sometimes in mongodb queries ). This way one can avoid unnecessary errors when reading *geojson* files/strings.


## geojsonR 1.0.1

I added a Vignette and corrected mistakes of the examples in the documentation


## geojsonR 1.0.0
